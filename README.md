#### Performing open science responsibly

#### Summary

#### Further Reading

### Lesson 2. Benefits and Challenges of Responsible Open Science: Why does it matter?

#### Introduction

#### Benefits of Open Science

#### Quality of research

#### Quality of scholarly communications

#### Response to societal challenges

#### Less unnecessary repetition is better for study participants

#### Personal/career benefits

#### Challenges in Open Science

#### Not everything should be open - don’t overshare without consent!

#### Preparing documentation, using standards, and creating metadata takes time and effort

#### Open community members don’t always agree with each other

#### Case scenarios in open communities

#### Cultural barriers: not everyone wants to change, and institutions often move slowly

### Lesson 3. Stakeholders of Open Science: Who practices Responsible Open Science and for whom?

#### Introduction

#### Who performs and benefits from open science? Stakeholders partaking in open science

#### Researchers

#### Public

#### Policy-makers

#### How each group contributes to Open Science

#### Case scenarios

##### Case Scenario #1:  Trend: Public —> Policy-makers

##### Case Scenario #2: Officialize: Policy-makers —> Researchers/Public

##### Case Scenario #3: Participate: Public —> Researchers

##### Case Scenario #4: Share:  Researchers —> Policy-makers/Public

#### How diverse stakeholders are included in open science

#### Activity/exercise

##### Case Scenario #1: Accessible figures and writing

##### Case Scenario #2: Organizing an inclusive physical event

##### Case Scenario #3: Organizing an inclusive virtual meeting and preparing in advance

#### Summary

### Lesson 4. Impact of Open Science on academia, communities and society as a whole: Where open science happens

#### Introduction

#### Legal frameworks that affect responsible open science

#### Data protection, privacy, and data sovereignty

#### European case: the General Data Protection Regulation

#### South African case: Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI Act) and Open Science

#### United States case: state legislation

#### Summary: Working in a global society with varied data protection laws

#### Whose laws apply to my community?

#### Equity and Open Science

#### A global perspective on open science

#### UNESCO on Open Science Infrastructure

### Lesson 5: Open Science resources & tools: How to get started in responsible Open Science

#### Introduction

##### Not an afterthought - plan for open science into the design

#### Perks of digital and internet age for responsible Open Science

#### Digital persistent identifiers - for objects and researchers

##### ORCID: A permanent unique identifier for you, as a scientific author

#### Sharing data, and software, and getting cited: Repositories you can use

#### Intellectual property, copyright, and licensing your content so it can be reused

#### Making your work useful to others

##### Sharing and publishing your manuscript

###### Public repository/Preprints

###### Publishing Open Science and Open Access

##### Discipline- and sector-specific nuances

###### Working with physical samples and tools

##### Authorship: recognizing the contributions and giving credit

#### Summary: think beforehand, design for open science, never an afterthought
